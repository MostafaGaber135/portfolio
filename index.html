            <p>I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Information Technology from the Egyptian E-Learning University. I
            am interested in the field of application development using Flutter, and I find in this field a great passion that
            always drives me to learn more and explore new technologies. Application development is not just a profession
            for me, it is a hobby that I enjoy practicing and I feel proud when seeing my results embodied in successful
            projects.
